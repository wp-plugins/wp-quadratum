Display your last Foursquare checkin as a map widget in the sidebar or embedded in a post or page, fully authenticated via OAuth 2.0.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to display your last Foursquare checkin as a map widget on the sidebar or embedded via a shortcode in a post or page of your WordPress powered site.

Setting and options include:

1. Associate your WordPress powered site with your [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) account using [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/), which keeps your personal information safe and secure.
1. Choose which map provider you want your checkin shown on; you can choose from:
	1. [HERE Maps](http://developer.here.com/javascript_api)
	1. [Google Maps v3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)
	1. [Bing Maps v7](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg427610.aspx)
	1. [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) from [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
	1. [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) from [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org)
	1. [OpenStreetMap]() from [MapQuest](http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open/sdk)
1. Add your maps API key(s) for your chosen map provider; HERE, Google, Bing and MapQuest maps all require API keys.
1. Choose the width and height of the widget and map on the sidebar. The width and height can be specified either as pixels (`px`) or as a percentage.
1. Choose the zoom level of the map display.

The <em>strapline</em> text containing the venue name, venue URL and timestamp of your last Foursquare checkin can be customised via the plugin's filters. See the *Filter Support And Usage* section for more information.

The current version of this plugin allows you to associate a single Foursquare account with your WordPress site; associating multiple Foursquare accounts, one per user account is not currently supported.

== Installation ==

1. You can install WP Quadratum automatically from the WordPress admin panel. From the Dashboard, navigate to the *Plugins / Add New* page and search for *"WP Quadratum"* and click on the *"Install Now"* link.
1. Or you can install WP Quadratum manually. Download the plugin Zip archive and uncompress it. Copy or upload the `wp-quadratum` folder to the `wp-content/plugins` folder on your web server.
1. Activate the plugin. From the Dashboard, navigate to Plugins and click on the *"Activate"* link under the entry for WP Quadratum.
1. Configure your Foursquare credentials; from the Dashboard, navigate to the *Settings / WP Quadratum* page or click on the *"Settings"* link from the Plugins page on the Dashboard.
1. To display your Foursquare checkins, WP Quadratum needs to be authorised to access your Foursquare account information; this is a simple, safe and secure 3 step process. WP Quadratum never sees your account login information and cannot store any personally identifiable information.
	1. Register your WordPress site as a Foursquare application on the [Foursquare App Registration](https://foursquare.com/developers/register) page. If you're not currently logged into your Foursquare account, you'll need to login with the Foursquare account whose checkins you want WP Quadratum to display. The *Your app name* field is a label you want to use to identify this connection to your Foursquare account. The *Download / welcome page url* is the URL of your Wordpress site. The *Redirect URI* will be provided for you and will be along the lines of http://www.yoursite.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-quadratum/includes/wp-quadratum-callback.php (this is just an example, *don't use this URL*). *Push API Notifications* should be set to *Disable pushes to this app*. All other fields can be left at their default values. Once you have successfully registered your site, you'll be provided with two keys, the *Client ID* and the *Client Secret*.
	1. Copy and paste the supplied *Client ID* and *Client Secret* into the respective WP Quadratum setting fields. Click on the *"Save Changes"* button to preserve them.
	1. You should now be authorised and ready to go; click on the *Connect to Foursquare* button.
1. Choose your mapping provider. From the *Maps* tab, select the map provider from the *Maps Provider* drop down.
1. If your chosen mapping provider requires an API key or keys, enter them as requested. If you don't have an API key, each maps provider tab has a link to the provider's site where you can sign up and obtain your API key. Click on the *Save Changes* button to save your credentials.
1. Add and configure a WP Quadratum Widget. From the Dashboard, navigate to *Appearance / Widgets* and drag the WP Quadratum Widget to your desired widget area.
1. You can configure the widget's title, with widget's width and map height in `px` or as a percentage and the map zoom level. Click on the *Save* button to preserve your changes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get help or support for this plugin? =

In short, very easily. But before you read any further, take a look at [Asking For WordPress Plugin Help And Support Without Tears](http://www.vicchi.org/2012/03/31/asking-for-wordpress-plugin-help-and-support-without-tears/) before firing off a question. In order of preference, you can ask a question on the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/wp-quadratum?forum_id=10); this is by far the best way so that other users can follow the conversation. You can ask me a question on Twitter; I'm [@vicchi](http://twitter.com/vicchi). Or you can drop me an email instead. I can't promise to answer your question but I do promise to answer and do my best to help.

= Is there a web site for this plugin? =

Absolutely. Go to the [WP Quadratum home page](http://www.vicchi.org/codeage/wp-quadratum/) for the latest information. There's also the official [WordPress plugin repository page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-quadratum/) and the [source for the plugin is on GitHub](http://vicchi.github.com/wp-quadratum/) as well.

= I have multiple authors on my site; can I have a widget for each author's Foursquare account? =

In the current version, no. In the current version, you can link a single Foursquare account with your WordPress site (multi-site or network sites may work, assuming each site is for a single user but I haven't tested this). The plugin is currently designed to support a WordPress site which is used for a personal blog (in other words, exactly the way my site is set up). Future versions of the plugin *may* support this if people ask for this feature (assuming anyone apart from myself actually *uses* it!).

= Can I change the format of the strapline that appears under the checkin map? =

Yes. The `wp_quadratum_strapline` filter is for just this purpose. The filter is passed the default strapline as well as the URL to the Foursquare venue checked in at, the name of the venue and the date and time of the checkin as a UNIX timestamp. See the *Filter Support And Usage* section for more information.

= I want to amend/hack/augment this plugin; can I do the same? =

Totally; this plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLV2). See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt for the full license terms.

= Where does the name WP Quadratum come from? =
WP Quadratum is named after both the Latin words *quattor*, meaning **four** and *quadratum*, meaning **square**.

== Shortcode Support And Usage ==

WP Quadratum supports a single shortcode, `[wp_quadratum]`. Adding this shortcode to the content of a post or page or into a theme template as content, expands the shortcode and replaces it with a checkin map.

The shortcode also supports multiple *attributes* which allow you to customise the way in which the shortcode is expanded into the checkin map:

* the `width` attribute
* the `width_units` attribute
* the `height` attribute
* the `height_units` attribute
* the `zoom` attribute

= The "width" Attribute =

The `width` attribute, in conjunction with the `height` attribute specifies the width of the map to be inserted into a post or page. If omitted, the map width defaults to a value of `300`.

= The "width_units" Attribute =

The `width_units` attribute, specifies how the value specified in the `width` attribute should be interpreted. Valid values for this attribute as `px` and `%`, denoting that the `width` attribute should be interpreted in pixels or as a percentage respectively. If omitted, this attribute defaults to a value of `px`.

= The "height" Attribute =

The `height` attribute, in conjunction with the `width` attribute specifies the height of the map to be inserted into a post or page. If omitted, the map height defaults to a value of `300`.

= The "height_units" Attribute =

The `height_units` attribute, specifies how the value specified in the `height` attribute should be interpreted. Valid values for this attribute as `px` and `%`, denoting that the `height` attribute should be interpreted in pixels or as a percentage respectively. If omitted, this attribute defaults to a value of `px`.

= The "zoom" Attribute =

The `zoom` attribute specifies the zoom level to be used when displaying the checkin map. If omitted, the zoom level defaults to a value of `16` which is roughly analogous to a neighbourhood zoom.

== Filter Support And Usage ==

WP Quadratum supports two filters, which are described in more detail below. The plugin's filters allow you to:

* change the descriptive text that appears immediately below the map when displayed via the plugin's widget or shortcode.
* gain access to the checkin metadata that is returned from the Foursquare API

= wp_quadratum_checkin =

Allow a filter hook function to gain access to the checkin metadata that is returned from the Foursquare API and which is used to build the checkin map and strapline. It's important to note that the implementation of this filter isn't strictly a WordPress filter per se. The user defined hook function is passed only the checkin metadata. Any changes made to the metadata will not be reflected in the output of the plugin's or shortcode's map, nor will any return value from the hook function be honoured by the plugin. The filter will be called before the `wp_quadratum_strapline` filter, if used, allowing you to store the checkin contents and use them within the `wp_quadratum_strapline` filter hook.

The contents of the checkin data this filter can access are a `Checkin Response` object, which is documented on the [Foursquare Developer Site](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/responses/checkin).

*Example:* Store the contents of the Foursquare checkin that the plugin will be to display the checkin map.

`$last_checkin = null;
add_filter('wp_quadratum_checkin', store_last_checkin, 10, 1);
function store_last_checkin($checkin) {
	$last_checkin = $checkin;
}`

= wp_quadratum_strapline =

Applied to the strapline that is displayed via the plugin's widget or shortcode. The strapline is the text that appears immediately below the checkin map.

*Example:* Change the date and time formatting in the strapline

`add_filter('wp_quadratum_strapline', 'format_strapline', 10, 2);
function format_strapline($content, $params) {
	// $params = array (
	//		'venue-url' => '4Sq venue url for checkin',
	//		'venue-name' => 'checkin venue name',
	//		'checked-in-at' => 'timestamp of checkin'
	//	);
	
	$strapline = '<h5>Last seen at <a href="' . $params['venue-url'] . '" target="_blank">' . $params['venue-name'] . '</a> on ' . date('l jS \of F Y h:i:s A', $params['checked-in-at']) . '</h5>';
	return $strapline;
}`
